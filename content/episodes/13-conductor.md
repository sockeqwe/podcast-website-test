In this episode we talked about Conductor with creator Eric Kuck.

**Announcement:** We have a new Co-Host for our podcast: Welcome [Artur Dryomov](https://twitter.com/arturdryomov)!

We think that we need at least two hosts on each episode to produce a high-quality content.
Unfortunately, podcast production is time-consuming but now there are three hosts, so we can ensure that at least two of us have time to produce a new episode regularly.

In this episode Artur and Hannes chatted with Eric Kuck about [Conductor](https://github.com/bluelinelabs/Conductor), a framework created by Eric as alternative to Fragments. We discussed:

 - Motivation behind Conductor
 - Conductor components: Controller, Router, ChangeHandler and ControllerTransaction
 - How Conductor works behind the scenes
 - Single Activity Applications
 - Testing
 - The future of Conductor

In the second part of episode 9 we have talked about build systems for android development: Gradle, Buck and Bazel

**Important note for Pocket Casts app users:**
Thanks to the great support of Pocket Casts team we were able to fix the "download episodes issue" (see show nodes of episode 9, part 1).

We have continued our discussion with Alexey Tsvetkov. In the second part we have talked about build systems for android development.

We have talked about:

 - [Gradle](https://gradle.org)
 - [Buck](https://buckbuild.com)
 - [Bazel](https://bazel.build)
